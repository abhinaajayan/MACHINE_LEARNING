# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can **learn from data**, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Instead of explicitly programming rules, machine learning algorithms improve their performance as they are exposed to more data.

> **Simple definition:**
> Machine Learning enables computers to learn from experience (data) and improve over time.

## Why Machine Learning is Important

Machine Learning is widely used because it can handle large and complex datasets and automate decision-making.

### Key Applications

* Spam email filtering
* Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon, YouTube)
* Image and speech recognition
* Medical diagnosis
* Fraud detection
* Self-driving cars
* Weather prediction

## Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning is mainly classified into **three types**:

### 1. Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the model is trained using **labeled data**, meaning the input data comes with correct output labels.

**Examples:**

* Email spam classification
* House price prediction
* Disease diagnosis

**Common Algorithms:**

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the model works with **unlabeled data** and tries to find hidden patterns or structures.

**Examples:**

* Customer segmentation
* Market basket analysis
* Anomaly detection

**Common Algorithms:**

* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

---

### 3. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an **agent** that learns by interacting with an **environment** and receiving **rewards or penalties**.

**Examples:**

* Game playing (Chess, Go)
* Robotics
* Autonomous vehicles

**Key Concepts:**

* Agent
* Environment
* Action
* Reward

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to improve model accuracy.

### Common Preprocessing Steps

* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicates
* Encoding categorical variables
* Feature scaling (Normalization / Standardization)
* Splitting data into training and testing sets

---

## Key Machine Learning Terms

* **Dataset:** Collection of data used for training/testing
* **Feature:** Input variable
* **Label:** Output variable
* **Model:** Mathematical representation learned from data
* **Training:** Process of learning from data
* **Testing:** Evaluating model performance
* **Overfitting:** Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
* **Underfitting:** Model is too simple to capture data patterns

---

## Model Evaluation Metrics

### For Classification

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score

### For Regression

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R-squared (R²)

## Advantages of Machine Learning

* Automates decision-making
* Handles large and complex datasets
* Improves performance over time
* Reduces human effort

---

## Limitations of Machine Learning

* Requires large amounts of data
* Can be biased if data is biased
* High computational cost
* Hard to interpret complex models

## Machine Learning vs Traditional Programming

| Traditional Programming | Machine Learning      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Rules + Data → Output   | Data + Output → Rules |
| Manual rule creation    | Automatic learning    |

## Tools and Libraries for Machine Learning

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch
